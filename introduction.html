    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
        In this chapter, I'll give you basic information about the course. 
        First, why Mamba? <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba</a> - is an architecture that was created by Albert Gu and Tri Dao to replace transformers.
        It is based on SSM's (which are recurrent models), therefor better than attention in complexity. 
        For me, it was the <span class="red">hardest</span> architecture by far to understand, because it is not as straightforward as transformers
        and you need to follow a lot of other papers and not just Mamba paper itself.
        Even if you don't know much about deep learning and you don't feel confident, I still sugest you to read this guide. 
        <br>
        <span class="green">I am going to cover anything you could possibly need.</span>

    <p>
        So little monkey, as we go deeper into the jungle, we will need to understand a couple of other papers,
        except Mamba. I want you to know, which paper we are disscussing, so I'll leave the links <span class="red">at the end</span> of
        each chapter.

        <br><br>

        In one chapter I usually will cover 1 or 2 papers. Images will look like this:

            from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00752
        </p>

    </center>

    <p>
        Also I'll show you my own implementation of whatever we discussed in the chapter. 
        So after all the theory, you will see the code. Also on <a href="https://github.com/Nursmen/Mamba_guide">github.</a>
        <br>
        That's all. Enjoy reading. If you want to make a contribution to the course, write me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nursultan-narynbaev-8020b5262/">Linkedin</a>.

        I promise to add your name somewhere at the starting page.
