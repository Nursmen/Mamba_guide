    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
        In this chapter, I'll give you basic information about the course. 
        First, let's make sure that we are on the same page. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba</a> - is an architecture that was created by Albert Gu and Tri Dao to replace transformers.
        It is based on SSM's (which are recurrent models), therefor better than attention in complexity. 
        For me, it was the hardest architecture by far to understand, because it is not as straightforward as transformers
        and you need to follow a lot of other papers and not just Mamba paper itself.
        Even if you don't know much about deep learning and you don't feel confident, I still sugest you to read this guide. 
        I am going to cover anything you could possibly need. <span class="green">Even if you don't know transformers. </span>

        So little monkey, as we go deeper into the jungle, we will need to understand a couple of other papers,
        except Mamba. I want you to know, which paper we are disscussing, so I'll leave the links <span class="red">at the end</span> of
        each chapter.

        In one chapter I usually will cover 1 or 2 papers. Images will look like this:
