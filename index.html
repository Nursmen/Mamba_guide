        Hello, my name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nursultan-narynbaev-8020b5262/">Nursultan</a>. This guide is intended to help <span class="red">any dummy on Earth</span> (just like myself) to understand Mamba architecture.
        You are more than welcome to skip any pages/chapters/paragraphs if you're already familiar with the topic. 
        This book is <span class="green">completely free for everyone</span>. Send this to whomever you want. Just remember to put my name in it. 
        <br><br>
        With me, little guy, you will go into the jungle to see one of the most dangerous themes to not understand...
